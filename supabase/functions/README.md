# Edge Functions

Deno-based Supabase Edge Functions. Each folder is one deployable function.

## Stubs to add as the product grows

These were part of the design and slot in here as new folders:

- `verify-selfie` — AI selfie/liveness check on signup; flips `profiles.is_verified`.
- `detect-spam-pattern` — DB webhook on message insert; flags blast/solicitation patterns.
- `send-accountability-email` — warm, specific accountability notices.
- `process-token-payout` — Stripe Connect / crypto payout from MGC balance.

## Local development

```bash
# start the local stack (Postgres + Auth + Studio + Edge Runtime)
supabase start

# serve a single function with hot reload
supabase functions serve recalculate-score --env-file ./supabase/.env.local
```

## Deploy

```bash
supabase functions deploy recalculate-score
supabase functions deploy file-report
```

## Secrets

Functions read these from the environment (never commit real values):

- `SUPABASE_URL`
- `SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`
- `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` — **server-side only**, full DB access. Never ship to the iOS client.

Set them with `supabase secrets set --env-file ./supabase/.env.local`.
